# Claude Session State - 2026-01-26

## Completed Tasks
1. Pulled and merged latest from master (eb61074 -> 1993cee)
2. Resolved merge conflicts by keeping master version for:
   - `services/position_tracker_rust/src/main.rs`
   - `services/signal_processor_rust/src/main.rs`
3. Local non-conflicting changes preserved (unstaged)

## Current Task: Docker Build Verification
**Status:** Blocked by Windows Docker BuildKit bug

### Issue
- Error: `changes out of order: "services/execution_service_rust" "rust_core/src/win_prob.rs"`
- This is a known Windows Docker Desktop BuildKit issue with file ordering during context transfer
- Occurs when running `docker-compose --profile full build`

### Attempted Solutions
1. `docker builder prune -f` - cleared 5.5GB cache, didn't fix
2. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` - legacy builder deprecated warning, still failed
3. Building individual services - same error
4. Direct `docker build` command - same error

### Recommended Next Steps After Restart
1. **Restart Docker Desktop** - most common fix for this Windows file ordering bug
2. Then run: `docker-compose --profile full build`
3. If still failing, try:
   - `docker system prune -a` (warning: removes all unused images)
   - Or build from WSL2 if available

## Git Status
- Branch: master (up to date with origin/master)
- Modified files (unstaged):
  - .gitignore
  - markets/paper/engine.py
  - reports/hot_wash_2026-01-24.html
  - reports/hot_wash_2026-01-24.md
  - rust_core/src/win_prob.rs
  - scripts/close_all_positions.py
  - services/api/main.py
  - services/game_shard_rust/src/shard.rs
  - services/notification_service_rust/Dockerfile
  - services/orchestrator_rust/Dockerfile

## Existing Docker Images (from ~11-13 hours ago)
- goodarbees-* images exist and may work if rebuild isn't required
- arbees-position-tracker-rust:latest also exists

## Commands to Resume
```bash
# After Docker Desktop restart:
cd P:/petes_code/ClaudeCode/Arbees
docker-compose --profile full build
docker-compose --profile full up -d
docker-compose --profile full ps
```
